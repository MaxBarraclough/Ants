                               About 'Ants'
==========================================================================

Unleashes [Lanton's Ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_Ant)
upon an image that you specify. Ants spawn at random locations.

Uses SFML 2.0 + OpenGL.

When the window has opened, hold 'p' to progress.


Usage: ants <image> <number of ants>

e.g    ants ./in.bmp 3


                              Disclaimer
==========================================================================

It's fairly bad. No proper testing, and uses antique OpenGL (and probably wrongly).
